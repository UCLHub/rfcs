## Summary

We introduce the set of features planned for the Initial Minimal Viable Product
(I-MVP) for the **UCL Hub** application.

## Motivation

We need to pin down a small set of features so that these features, considered
critically important for our purposes, can be feasibly implemented by a small
team of developers towards the middle or end of January.

## Guide-level Explanation

### Guiding Principles

**UCL Hub** is an *open-source*, *not-for-profit* student assistant and student
community application.

We wish to:

1. improve the **accessibility** of UCL and UCL-related information for UCL
   students;
2. help build a *welcoming and inclusive community* among UCL students.

### Target Audience

Our target audience is **UCL students**, including those who are currently
enrolled as well as offer-holders (collectively, UCL students).

These students may want to *discuss* and *share information* among fellow
students w.r.t. to topics such as:

- Second-hand item trading (place for information, but not a "market")
- Housing (residence)
- Questions and Answers (Q&A)
- Recommended resources and notes
- Career advice or information
- Lost & Found
- Course discussion
- Meme sharing
- General (photo, info, opportunity) sharing
- Societies and clubs (society pages, membership cards, events, discussions)

They may also wish to receive *personalized assistance and curated information*
such as:

- Have easy access to their timetables (personal, course)
- Transition Mentor style advice (especially for offer holder and new students)
- Check library and study space status (number of occupied seats, opening
  times)
   - We can link to UCL library's booking service (no available API)
- Check empty lecture rooms based on time (e.g. next hour availability, see
  UCL Assistant)
- Restaurants and cafe around the campus (possibly in the vicinity of the
  campus as well)
- Professor and staff info look up (email address, dept, name)
- Link to commonly used UCL services
- Current COVID-19 situation (guidelines, restrictions, clusters, pandemic
  severeness, vaccine development status)
- TfL status (tube line status, buses router - maybe in the end)

## Reference-level Explanation

There's a *lot* of potentially desired features, but given the small team size
and timeframe, we need to reduce the possible requirements down to a core set
that delivers the most value for UCL students. The selection and prioritization
of these features were conducted through a meeting by design team members
[1].

As such, we designate two sets of **core functional requirements**:

1. **Personalized Information and Guidance**.
2. **Student Community Facilities**.
   - To ensure *constructive* and *inclusive* community-building, it is
     inevitable that we also require first-class community moderation tooling.

To align with our guiding principles, we also designate two sets of
**core non-functional requirements**:

1. **Accessibility**.
2. **Privacy and Safety**.

The two non-functional requirements will also help us address security issues,
such as securing personal information, as well as legal issues, such as to
comply with regulations and laws such as the GDPR by only giving personal
information to authorized parties when the user explicitly consents
(vis-a-vis opt-in personal information sharing).

### Core Functional Requirements

#### Personalized Information and Guidance

1. Personal timetable
    1. Daily view
    2. Weekly view
    3. Monthly view
2. Library and study space availability
    1. Absolute number of seats available
    2. Percentage of seats available
    3. Sorting (by name, available seats)
    4. User favourite libraries
3. COVID-19 information
    1. Daily, weekly and monthly change in number of cases (infected, deaths,
       recovered, suspected/quarantined)
    2. Daily, weekly and monthly change in total number of cases
    3. Nearby cases
    4. Trends by different date intervals
    5. Protection information (UK government-issued guidance + China
4. Transport for London (TfL) tube status
       government-issued guidance + UCL guidance)

#### Student Community Facilities

1. General Forum
    1. Publish posts with text, images and links
        1. Allow comments
    2. Separate multiple locales (initially zh, en)
    3. Post category
    4. View a list of posts
    5. Filter by category, sort by publish date
2. Second-hand Market (**not** C2C/B2C, *only* to allow information exchange,
   we do not handle transactions)
    1. Filter by item type, publish date, price range
3. User Profile Management and Display
    1. Select info to display
    2. User profile information (selective visibility):
        1. First name, middle name and last name (optional)
        2. Programme
        3. Education level
        4. Year of study
        5. Profile picture
        6. Email
        7. Social media links (facebook, twitter, instagram, github for now)
        8. Phone number
    3. Contact details
    4. Verified UCL student status (via UCL API)

## Drawbacks

- Some features are sacrificed to make the workload feasible for the Intial
  MVP.

## Scope and Effort

It is expected that these features be designed, implemented, tested and
evaluated towards the middle or end of January to the level of completenesss
that would be expected for a Public Beta.

## Prior Art

- UCL Assistant
- UCL Go
- UCLCSSA WeChat Miniapp

## Unresolved Questions

- How do we gather and analyze user feedback to improve the design?

## Future Possibilities

Possible desired features by users that were not included in the Initial
MVP was also listed in the Target Audience section; also see [1] for more
ideas.
